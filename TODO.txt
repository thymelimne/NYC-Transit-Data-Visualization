NOW TODO:
- Do an animation, just between two time intervals.



LATER TODO:
- Hover-info : When I hover the cursor over a station, I want it to easily give a little blurb on it, maybe just the title of the station or something. The description goes away when I move the mouse away from it.
- Click-info : When I click on a station, something happens.
    - Helloworld on this feature : Just make anything happen.
    - Station grows a little bit, on the Leaflet map.
- Do a 'proper' Python EDA

This is a matter of decisiveness: What features do I want?
The choice I make will dictate how I pipe the data around.

animation *

I'm still trying to eschew decisiveness, and look into how much data there is total.
(Maximum limit would be 10million rows, assuming I end up using Heroku Postgres)
GLOSS:
animation
UTILITY:
looking up exact facts about a specific station or location

!!!idea: Pruning.
Only concern myself with spots where there's actually motion;
that'll decrease the amount of rows specifically.
Let's say, <100 occurences happened at that place? It doesn't get marked.
